                          But people know me more as <b>Onika</b>. I am a fresh graduate from <b>Mindanao State University - General Santos City</b>. I studied <b>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology major in Networks</b>.

                        <p>
                         I wanted to study and pursue my passion but because of financial issues, I settled with the scholarship that I got from MSU-GSC and enrolled in the course with the shortest line. Before I entered the university, I was downcasted and bitter. Little did I know that <b>the closed doors before me was to open a new dimension and form of art for me to explore</b>.

                        <p>
                        Because of how I got into Information Technology, I was having a hard time studying <i>(no, I did not have bad grades)</i>. Learning how to code was hard for me because of my grief. I had CS/IT <i>senpais</i> and my <i>sensei</i> to help me during my first year in college. They witnessed all my struggles and how I was about to give up without even trying to survive the course. I never appreciated my course not until I had my internship in the ICTO department of MSU-GSC. I had my first encounter with <b>Figma</b> and I was designing the dashboard for the proposed <i>Student Portal</i> for MSU-GSC. A staff told me that I could be a great developer and that I should pursue it. His simple words encouraged me and after my duty, I found myself studying and learning more about <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>. Long story short, I fell in love with it <i>(and I still have a long way to go)</i>!

                        <h1>My Introverted Lifestyle</h1>
                        <p>
                        Right after graduation, I had job offers from different companies from my city and even outside the country. However, upon observing my performance during my internship and even throughout my college years, I find myself more productive working at night... <b>in my room</b>. The job offers were great but what good can a great offer do compared to a working set up that naturally unleashes your productivity? 
                          
                          <i>(Yes, I am a huge introvert but I still have a life outside my room. I am a normal 22 year old kid who doesn't talk much but still gets adopted by extroverted adult friends).</i>
